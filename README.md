# Personal Website

This is a personal website that I built for fun using Astro, React, and Tailwind. I wanted to take a deeper dive into Web Dev, especially using Strict Typescript.

It was a fun learning experience, but since this is my first time developing with modern frameworks, there may be a few things that don't work as expected. If you notice anything that can be fixed, don't hesitate to open up an issue on Github!

## Main Features

- Component-first design
- Light and Dark mode via Theme Button
- Mobile support via separate Menu dropdown when screen is resized for Navigation bar
- Used Astro's `content` folder structure for Markdown content to display content within pages
