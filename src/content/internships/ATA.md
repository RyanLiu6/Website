#### Software Engineer Intern :: May 2019 - Aug. 2019
* Resolved critical issue with Kafka-to-BigQuery replication lag due to schema changes by notifying contributing engineer(s) via Slack DMs and then seamlessly applying schema changes without any further input from users
* Coordinated with senior engineers and leadership to determine impact and requirements to successfully migrate existing local environments from Virtual Machines to Docker
* Developed internal tools to facilitate the actual move from VMs to using Docker, including tools to create our own custom Docker images
