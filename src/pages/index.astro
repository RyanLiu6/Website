        I'm a Software Engineer based in Vancouver, Canada, and I'm passionate about Software, Games, Plamo, and all things in between.
        Currently attempting on something cool with <TextLink href="https://foundryvtt.com" title="FoundryVTT">Foundry</TextLink> in my spare time.

        PS: This website is constantly being worked on, so some things may not work as expected!
        I'm still learning lots about Web Dev and Frameworks like AstroJS, React, and Tailwind.
        If you notice anything that can be fixed, don't hesitate to open up an issue on Github!
