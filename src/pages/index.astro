        I'm a Software Engineer based in Vancouver, Canada, and I'm passionate about Software,
        Games, Plamo, and all things in between. Currently attempting on something cool with <TextLink
          href="https://foundryvtt.com"
          title="FoundryVTT">Foundry</TextLink
        > in my spare time.

        PS: This website is constantly being worked on, so some things may not work as expected! I'm
        still learning lots about modern Web Dev using frameworks like Astro, React, and Tailwind.
        If you notice anything that can be fixed, don't hesitate to open up an issue on Github!
